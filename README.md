### Hello there! 👋
Welcome to my profile! I'm Sara Martín, Frontend Developer. 

Since last year, I've deepened my knowledge in Programming Languages related to Web Development and Data Analytics.

In regard to Web Development, I implement BEM methodology on my work, and I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript and frameworks like Angular and ReactJS. I also have knowledge of other languages and libraries as jQuery or PHP. As to Data Analysis, I have a grasp of Python and MySQL for Machine Learning.

Above all, I'm an eager learner who enjoys all the benefits of team-working.

### Anything else?
Yes! My university studies were focused on Spanish Philology and Language Teaching, which gave me a good insight of literature and linguistics. 
I also enjoy creative activities such as 📷 Photography, 📄 Origami or 🎭 Improv Theatre.
